iDatacenter is an app that gives you the power to administer you virtual datacenter from anywhere, using just your iPad. You can follow vital statistics on a virtual machine, a physical host or an entire datacenter. Virtual machines can be restarted, shut down, and moved to a different datastore.

The following features are supported in the current version of iDatacenter:

• Aggregate statistics per datacenter.

• Individual statistics and status for each physical host, virtual machine.

• Search/filter to find the host or virtual machine you are looking for.

• Use Storage vMotion to migrate a virtual machine from one datastore to another.

• Suspend and power on/off virtual machines.

• Soft reboot and soft shutdown of virtual machine with VMWare Tools installed.

• Enter and exit maintenance mode, disconnect and reconnect, reboot or shutdown hosts.

• Data cache for fast startup and navigation.

Features only supported when they are present in the underlying vCenter installation. Some features may require specific licenses acquired separately from VMWare. Free versions of vSphere Hypervisor can be connected, but are read only.

iDatacenter requires:

• a vCenter Server, version 4.0 or newer.

• a network connection that is allowed to connect to the vCenter Server. The iPads built-in VPN client can be used.
